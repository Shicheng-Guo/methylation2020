RNA-seq for drug response cluster analysis
Long Ma, Minyi Chen, Shicheng Guo and Momiao Xiong
Abstract
Digital transcriptome analysis by next-generation sequencing discovers substantial mRNA variants. Variation in gene expression underlies many biological processes and holds a key to unraveling mechanism of common diseases and drug response. However, the current methods for drug response prediction using overall gene-expression are originally designed for microarray expression data and overlook a large number of variations in gene expressions. To utilize expression information at genomic positional level we use sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) techniques which project the original high dimensional data to very low dimensional space while preserving all information on response phenotypes and functional principal component analysis methods to develop novel statistical methods for classification  with RNA-seq data. The proposed methods are applied to ovarian cancer drug response RNA-seq and microarray expression data from TCGA database where  expressions of 163 sensitive and 70 resistant to drug ovarian cancer samples were measured by RNA-seq and microarray.  Tenfold cross validation was used to evaluate the performance of classifier.  We can reach 100\%, 100\% and 100\% average classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, respectively, in the test datasets for RNA-seq data, and 63.54\%, 88.85\% and 10.43\% average classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, respectively, in the test datasets for microarray-measured expression dataset. Our results strongly demonstrate that the prediction based on RNA-seq substantially outperforms the prediction based on the microarray expressions.
