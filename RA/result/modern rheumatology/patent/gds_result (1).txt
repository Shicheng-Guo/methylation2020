(Submitter supplied) Using the Infinium HM450 platform, we have performed a longitudinal study of DNA methylation at birth and age 18 months in DNA from buccal swabs from 10 monozygotic (MZ) and 5 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs from the Peri/postnatal Epigenetic Twins Study (PETS) cohort.

2. Inactive or moderately active human promoters are enriched for inter-individual epialleles [Methylation BeadChip]
(Submitter supplied) We first demonstrate that non-genetically determined inter-individual differentially methylated regions (iiDMRs) can be temporally stable for at least two years. Then, we show that iiDMRS are associated with concomitant changes in chromatin state as measured by inter-individual differences in the levels of the histone variant H2A.Z. However, the correlation of promoter iiDMRs with gene expression is negligible and this correlation is not improved even by integrating H2A.Z information. more...

3. Epigenome-wide analysis of monozygotic twin pairs discordant for body mass index
(Submitter supplied) Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of MZ twins discordant and concordant for BMI. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,000 CpGs. Samples included 30 MZ twin pairs discordant for BMI and 10 pairs concordant for BMI.

5. H3K4me1 marks DNA regions hypomethylated during aging in human stem and differentiated cells [twins]
(Submitter supplied) In differentiated cells, aging is associated with hypermethylation of DNA regions enriched in repressive histone posttranslational modifications. However, the chromatin marks associated with changes in DNA methylation in adult stem cells during lifetime are still largely unknown. Here, DNA methylation profiling of mesenchymal stem cells obtained from individuals aged 2 to 92 identified 18735 hypermethylated and 45407 hypomethylated CpG sites associated with aging. more...

6. DNA Methylation Profiling of Human Saliva
(Submitter supplied) Background: Low birth weight is associated with an increased adult metabolic disease risk. It is widely discussed that poor intrauterine conditions could induce long-lasting epigenetic modifications, leading to systemic changes in regulation of metabolic genes. In a unique cohort of 17 monozygotic (MZ) monochorionic female twins very discordant for birth weight (relative differences ranging from 21.3-35.7%), we examined if adverse prenatal growth conditions experienced by the smaller co-twins lead to systemic long-lasting DNA methylation changes. more...
