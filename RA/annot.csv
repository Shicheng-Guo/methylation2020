The histogram yielded a right-skewed unimodal distribution curve with a mode of approximately 0.013.  A normal distribution curve representing the variability of the data around zero was then fitted around the mode, mirroring the Gaussian profile of the left part of the histogram. Its parameters were then defined (mean, SD) and the data were normalized to the standard deviation of the noise after subtraction of the mean. The data were then Log10-transformed and adjusted to each other by robust linear regression under the assumption that the methylation of most genes does not change. The data were then filtered to remove genes with a methylation level value less than 3.0, equivalent to setting a threshold at three standard deviations above the noise level. Genes with methylation differential below the noise level under all experimental conditions (about 1,600) were excluded from consideration, as their methylation cannot be reliably assessed.","GPL8490","Mikhail,,Dozmorov","mdozmorov@vcu.edu","804-628-0260","Biostatistics","Virginia Commonwealth University","1200 E Clay St","Richmond","VA","23298","USA","NONE","27578"
