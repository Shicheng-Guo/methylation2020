e58735f3-d897-5033-929e-e92249ec34cb	21938	sample	0120344d-7346-409f-8518-ef7b13f867ff	BCR Notification	Notification	2014-09-04T00:00:00	Approved	Possible tumor/normal sample swap, cross-contamination, and/or sample purity issues. The sequencing and characterization centers have reported that molecular signatures from the DNA and RNA from the tumor and normal tissue, as well as DNA from the blood derived normal, do not cluster with the expected sample types. This suggests the tumor and normal samples may not be labeled correctly; all genotyping results confirm that all samples are from the same patient. Data from this patient should be used with caution.
