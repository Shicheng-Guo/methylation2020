Here we try to screen 50 CpG loci in ESCA to do some basic research.

2, DMR
3, GWAS

```{r}
setwd("C:\\Users\\shicheng\\Dropbox\\Project\\methylation\\esca")
data<-read.table("TCGA.Meth450.esca.ChAMP.DMS.txt",head=T,as.is=T)

x<-c(1156,839,1067,934)
y<-matrix(x,2,2)
chisq.test(y)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
