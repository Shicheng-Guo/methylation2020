Summary receiver operating characteristic curve for diagnostic capacity of FHIT methylation

Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.357(95%CI: 0.320-0.395, P<0.0001) and 0.872(95%CI: 0.793-0.924,P<0.0001)
 for all the studies based on the presupposition of the fixed effects model. The sensitivity of the tissue group was similar with that of the serum group, 0.363(95% CI: 0.326-0.402, P<0.0001) versus 0.337(95% CI: 0.270-0.412, P<0.0001) , while the specificity of the tissue group was slightly lower than that of the serum group, 0.883(95% CI: 0.791-0.937, P<0.0001) versus 0.902(95% CI: 0.694-0.902, P<0.0001), which suggested the biomarker would have adequated ability both in tissues and  remote non-invasive media.

Although sensitivity and specificity were two of most important features of a diagnostic test, in some occasions, pooling sensitivity or specificity could be misleading as mentioned in the Methods section. Therefore, we constructed the summery receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve to depict the stability and accuracy of the methylation testâ€™s diagnostic ability. The area under the curve (AUC) of the SROC was 0.44, suggesting a median ability for NSCLC diagnosis (Figure 2F). Meanwhile, the AUC of the SROC for the serum and the tissue group was 0.364 and 0.437 respectively, showing slightly better performances for the FHIT methylation test in serum and tissue samples.

Bias analysis and robust estimation of pooled OR
A funnel plot of methylation status of lung cancer tissue versus normal tissue based on Linear regression test of funnel plot asymmetry showed significant publication bias(Egger test, z =2.7571, P=0.01865) and  7 studies exceeded the 95% confidence limits (Additional file 2: Figure S1). In order to eliminate the effect of publication bias, trim and fill analysis was performed with the random effects model. The adjusted pooled OR were 2.09 (95% CI: 1.10 to 3.96, P =0.0242) in the random effects model and 1.83 (95% CI: 1.45 to 2.32, P < 0.0001) in the fixed effects model. Both results demonstrate a significantly positive association between FHIT methylation and NSCLC (Additional file 2: Figure S2).
In sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of omitting a single study on the overall effect, the overall ORs were between 2.97 (95% CI: 1.64 to 5.37) and 4.10 (95% CI: 2.17 to 7.76) in the random effects method, which suggested that combined OR was consistent and reliable (Additional file 2: Figure S3).
