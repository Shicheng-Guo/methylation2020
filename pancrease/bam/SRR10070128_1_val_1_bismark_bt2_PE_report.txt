Bismark report for: ../fastq_trim/SRR10070128_1_val_1.fq.gz and ../fastq_trim/SRR10070128_2_val_2.fq.gz (version: v0.19.1)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /mnt/bigdata/Genetic/Projects/shg047/db/hg19/bismark/ with the specified options: -q --phred33 -N 1 --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	176194709
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	24799653
Mapping efficiency:	14.1% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	150048501
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	1346555
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	11

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	12409713	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	12389929	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
