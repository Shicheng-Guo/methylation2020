We are trying to prove the assumption that cell-type level analysis is essential and critical in the study of Alzheimer's disease.

To test this hypothesis, we applied deconvolution analysis to test the differential celltype contribution between the samples with AD or without AD.
From the result, we found several celltypes (Ex6, Ex8, In6) have significant celltype contribution in general gene expression between case and control samples. (File.Deconv_rlt, Tab.'DiffExp by Celltype')

To deep dived this phenomenon in gene level, we test the differential expression cross genes generally as well as in celltype level.
From the result, we provided all the genes with significant differential expression observations in at least one celltypes or in general level. (File.Deconv_rlt, Tab.'DiffExp by Gene')
Within these genes, 133 could be found significant in general level. Within the 133 genes, 35 could be found also significant cross all celltypes. 275 genes didn't deliver a significant differential expression generally but could be found significant in at least one celltype. (File.Deconv_rlt, Tab.'For Venn')

Considerring the impact from experimental error, we also ran the same test with 30% component information excluded.

For the same goal, we are trying to identify the difference gene-gene expression among different celltypes.

To get the result, we applied the structural equation and search and score algorithm to build the causal network on signaling pathways generally as well as in celltype levels.
We used jaccard score (count of dupplicated edges / count of total edges) to measure the consistency cross different networks. And a range of 24%~98% overlap could be found between networks. (File.deconv_network_result, Tab.'Network Overlap')
We also tested the stability of each edges (Frequency of occurrence among networks). And a range of 12%~94% stability could be found cross edges. (File.deconv_network_result, Tab.'Network Overlap2')

Not only test the differential expression by gene seperately, we have also tried to test the differential expression within pathways.
We applied hotelling test to test mutli gene differential expression within pathways between AD positive and negative. (Also other diseases have been test in the same file)
From the results, we provided all the test pvalue of overal gene expression or cell type levels corss pathways for five diseases. (File.Deconv_hotelling_test, Tab.'All data output'). The strictly significant level should be 3E-6.
For the result, there weren't any significant difference pathway found while considerring the overall gene expression under 30% component excluded for AD. However 3 were found sinificant in 9 celltype*pathway and all of them could be confirmed by existed literature.(File.Deconv_hotelling_test, Tab.'Significant Code for AD')
